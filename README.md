![peepeepass-ezgif com-crop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40c798ce-e99d-4858-92da-1b37ede50a8a)


PyPass generates a random 12 character password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols

Running the script will already generate the password and then ask the user what service it is for and the username being used and saves the data into the same folder as the script

> [!NOTE]
> You can change the length of the password in ***line 9***

The data will be in a text file named ***user_data.txt***

Running the script is simple, clone the repo and type:
```
python pypass.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> There will always be one ***user_data.txt*** the more you use the script, the data will addon and save into the file

> [!TIP]
> Make sure Python is installed on your machine, no requirements are needed
